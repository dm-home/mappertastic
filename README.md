This demo showcases Leaflet with the **Leaflet.Editable** plugin to allow editing of drawn shapes.  Both the plugin and its optional Path.Drag dependency are bundled in the `lib/` directory so the page works without external CDN access.

The viewer now includes a basemap selector with imagery from USGS, Stadia Maps, and TopPlus.  The TopPlus grey map is selected by default.  The upload control has also been styled with a larger font for easier access.

The plugin is distributed under the MIT license; see the Leaflet.Editable repository for details.
