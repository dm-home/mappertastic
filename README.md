This demo uses Leaflet for web mapping and includes the
`Leaflet.Editable` plugin for geometry editing. The plugin is now loaded
from the official CDN (`unpkg`). If your environment blocks CDN requests,
download the plugin locally and adjust the script tag accordingly.

The plugin is distributed under the MIT license; see the Leaflet.Editable
repository for details.
