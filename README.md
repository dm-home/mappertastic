This demo uses Leaflet for web mapping and includes the
`Leaflet.Editable` plugin for geometry editing. A local copy of the plugin
(`Leaflet.Editable.js`) is included to avoid issues with blocked CDN
requests.

The plugin is distributed under the MIT license; see the Leaflet.Editable
repository for details.
